## üòÅ About

[Actionsflow](https://github.com/actionsflow/actionsflow) helps you to automate workflows, it's the best [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/)/[Zapier](https://zapier.com/) free alternative for developers. With [Actionsflow](https://github.com/actionsflow/actionsflow), you can connect your favorite apps, data, and APIs, receive notifications of actions as they occur, sync files, collect data, and more. We implemented it based on [Github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), and you use a YAML file (The configuration format is the same as [Github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow)) to build your workflows. If you have already written a [Github actions file](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow), it's very easy to define an Actionsflow workflow file, and you can use any [Github actions](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) as your job's steps.

You can see core concepts of Actionsflow at [here](#-how-actionsflow-worked).

## üî• Features

- **support almost all actions of github**, you can use almost all [Github actions](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions). Actionsflow use [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) for running [Github actions](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions). With [Github actions](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions), You can connect with IFTTT, Zapier, or the other services.
- **Easy to write workflow file**, the Actionsflow configuration format is the same as [Github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow), If you have already written a [Github actions file](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow), it's very easy to define an Actionsflow workflow file,

## üëÄ How Actionsflow worked

Actionsflow uses [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)' [**`repository_dispatch` event**](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#repository_dispatch) and [**per 5 minutes' `scheduled` event**](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events) to run [Actionsflow triggers](https://actionsflow.github.io/docs/triggers/) for getting result **items**, and do some caching and deduplication works, then generating a standard Github actions workflow file with the trigger result, then calling [act](https://github.com/nektos/act)(a tool for running GitHub Actions locally) to run the built workflow files.

Learn more about How Actionsflow worked, please see [Core Concepts of Actionsflow](https://actionsflow.github.io/docs/concepts/).

## üèÅ Getting Started

Build an Actionsflow workflow is a three-step process:

1. **Create a public Github repository by this [link](https://github.com/actionsflow/actionsflow-workflow-default/generate).**

   A typical Actionsflow repository structure looks like this:

   ```sh
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows
   ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ actionsflow-jobs.yml
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rss.yml
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ webhook.yml
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
   ```

1. **Define your [workflow file](https://actionsflow.github.io/docs/workflow/) at `workflows` directory**

   A typical workflow file `rss.yml` looks like this:

   ```yaml
   on:
     rss:
       url: https://hnrss.org/newest?points=300
   jobs:
     ifttt:
       name: Make a Request to IFTTT
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actionsflow/ifttt-webhook-action@v1
           with:
             event: notice
             key: ${{ secrets.IFTTT_KEY }}
             value1: ${{on.rss.outputs.title}}
             value2: ${{on.rss.outputs.contentSnippet}}
             value3: ${{on.rss.outputs.link}}
   ```

   For more information about the Actionsflow workflow file, see the
   [Actionsflow workflow reference](https://actionsflow.github.io/docs/workflow/).

   You can explore [Triggers List](https://actionsflow.github.io/docs/triggers/) or [Awesome Actionsflow Workflows](https://github.com/actionsflow/awesome-actionsflow/) to get more inspired.

1. **commit and push your updates to Github**

Then, Actionsflow will run your workflows as you defined, you can view logs at your repository actions tab at [Github](https://github.com)

For more information about quick started, see [Getting Started](https://actionsflow.github.io/docs/getting-started/)
