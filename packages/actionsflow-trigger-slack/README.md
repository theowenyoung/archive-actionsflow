# `@actionsflow/trigger-slack`

This is an [Actionsflow](https://github.com/actionsflow/actionsflow) [slack](https://slack.com/) trigger. `slack` trigger is triggered when new messages of slack channel are detected.

> This is an official trigger, you don't need to install it manually.

[View trigger on Github](https://github.com/actionsflow/actionsflow/tree/master/packages/actionsflow-trigger-slack)

## Prerequisites

We used [Slack Outgoing Webhook](https://actionsflow.slack.com/apps/A0F7VRG6Q-outgoing-webhooks?next_id=0) to implement this trigger. So, you should add [Outgoing Webhook](https://actionsflow.slack.com/apps/A0F7VRG6Q-outgoing-webhooks?next_id=0) to your Slack workspace, and set `https://webhook.actionsflow.workers.dev/<owner>/<repo>/<workflow-file-name>/slack?__token=<your-github-personal-token>` as your webhook `URL(s)`

> You can configure the Channel or Trigger Word you want to watch at there.
