## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

[Actionsflow](https://github.com/actionsflow/actionsflow) is a tool for developers to build and run workflows. Like [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/), [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), with [Actionsflow](https://github.com/actionsflow/actionsflow), you can run a workflow that is triggered by RSS, Webhook, Poll, Telegram Bot, and the other triggers that Actionsflow supported. we implemented it by using [Github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), and you use a YAML file (The configuration format is the same as [Github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow) ) to build your workflows. It's easy to configure, and you can use any [Github actions](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) as your job's steps.

You can see core concepts of Actionsflow at [here](#howactionsflowworked).

## üéì Document <a name="document"></a>

Full documentation for Actionsflow lives [on the website](https://actionsflow.github.io/docs/).

You can also [view it at Github](/docs/index.md) if you prefer.

## üëÄ How Actionsflow worked <a name = "howactiionsflowworked"></a>

Actionsflow setup a Github scheduled action with running every 5 minutes, Actionsflow will check if there are any updates with the triggers in the workflows, if Actionsflow found an updated item, it will generate a standard Github actions workflow file with the item payload, and call [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to run the built workflow.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Build an Actionsflow workflows is basically a three-step process:

1. Create a public Github repository by this [link](https://github.com/actionsflow/workflow/generate)
1. Define your [workflow files](/docs/reference/0-workflow-syntax.md) at `workflows` directory, you can find some workflow file examples at [here](https://github.com/actionsflow/actionsflow/tree/master/examples/workflows)
1. commit and push your updates to Github

Then, Actionsflow will run your workflows as you defined, you can view logs at your repository actions tab at [Github](https://github.com)

For more information about quick started, see [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started.md)

### Structure
