Like [Github actions workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions), A Actionsflow workflow is a configurable automated process made up of one or more jobs. You must create a YAML file to define your workflow configuration. The Actionsflow configuration format is the same as [Github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow)
