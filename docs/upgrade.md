If there are no breaking changes for Actionsflow, the [Actionsflow action](https://github.com/actionsflow/workflow/blob/master/.github/workflows/actionsflow-jobs.yml) will auto use the latest release version.

If there are breaking changes, you should follow the upgrade guide to upgrade.

Generally, to update an existing workflow repository to a new version of Actionsflow, just replace the latest [actionsflow-jobs.yml](https://github.com/actionsflow/workflow/blob/master/.github/workflows/actionsflow-jobs.yml) to your workflow repository.
