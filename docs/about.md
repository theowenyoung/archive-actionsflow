[Actionsflow](https://github.com/actionsflow/actionsflow) is a tool for developers to build and run workflows. Like [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/), [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), with [Actionsflow](https://github.com/actionsflow/actionsflow), you can run a workflow that is triggered by RSS, Webhook, Poll, Telegram Bot, and the other triggers that Actionsflow supported.

I started this project because I need to watch some RSS and do something, but I can't found a free platform that support complicated workflows. I want to thank Github providing a totally free CI platform [Github actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for open source project, so I can do some work to provide an easy way for workflow that Github actions not support yet.
